            THURSDAY is a prototype AutoML tool that can be used to visualize comparisons from model generate from
            AutoML libraries and later on the ability to create a model of your own. This prototype was created as a project for a class at UNR for CS 791 Software Engineering. 
            Navigate to create model to get started in generating a model. Go to evaluate model if you wish to see how the present the models that have been generated are doing in generating data. 
            Go to view model (not implemented at this time) in order to see what the model looks like.

        <p> Presently this
            tool supports only AutoKeras, but more will be added soon.</p>
